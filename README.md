# Email-Spam-Detection
Developed an Email Spam Detection System using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm on a Kaggle dataset and built a web app using Django for user-friendly spam classification.
📧 Email Spam Detection Web App 🚀
A Django web application that integrates a Machine Learning model to detect spam emails with 99% accuracy. This project transforms the spam detection model into an interactive web application that anyone can use, even without coding knowledge.

🖥️ Features
✅ Django Web App Setup – Configured a Django project and app from scratch.
✅ User Input Forms – Created forms to allow users to enter email content for spam detection.
✅ ML Model Integration – Integrated a pre-trained spam detection model built in Google Colab.
✅ Interactive UI – Developed a simple and intuitive HTML/CSS interface for easy interaction.
✅ Real-Time Spam Detection – Users get instant results on whether an email is spam or not.
✅ Accuracy & Performance – Achieved 99% accuracy in detecting spam emails.
