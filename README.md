# 📧 Email Spam Detection Web App 🚀

Developed an Email Spam Detection System using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm on a Kaggle dataset and built a web app using Django for user-friendly spam classification.

A Django web application that integrates a Machine Learning model to detect spam emails with 99% accuracy. This project transforms the spam detection model into an interactive web application that anyone can use, even without coding knowledge.

## 🖥️ Features
1. ***Django Web App Setup*** – Configured a Django project and app from scratch.
2. ***User Input Forms*** – Created forms to allow users to enter email content for spam detection.
3. ***ML Model Integration*** – Integrated a pre-trained spam detection model built in Google Colab.
4. ***Interactive UI*** – Developed a simple and intuitive HTML/CSS interface for easy interaction.
5. ***Real-Time Spam Detection*** – Users get instant results on whether an email is spam or not.
6. ***Accuracy & Performance*** – Achieved 99% accuracy in detecting spam emails.
